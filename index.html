    <h1>Hippo Facts</h1>

    <p>
        The hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), also called the hippo, common hippopotamus or river
      hippopotamus, is a large, mostly herbivorous, semiaquatic mammal and
      ungulate native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is one of only two extant
      species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy
      hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis). The
      name comes from the ancient Greek for "river horse". After
      the elephant and rhinoceros, both of which are found in Africa, the
      hippopotamus is the third-largest type of land mammal and the heaviest
      extant artiodactyl (in the traditional, non-cladistic sense of the term,
      not including cetaceans). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, the closest living relatives of the
      Hippopotamidae are cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises, etc.), from
      which they diverged about 55 million years ago. Hippos are recognisable by
      their barrel-shaped torsos, wide-opening mouths revealing large canine
      tusks, nearly hairless bodies, columnar legs and large size; adults
      average 1,500 kg (3,310 lb) for males and 1,300 kg (2,870 lb) for females.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running 30 km/h
      (19 mph) over short distances. Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and mangrove
      swamps, where territorial males preside over a stretch of river and groups
      of five to thirty females and young hippos. During the day, they remain
      cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both
      occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippos rest
      near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos
      are not territorial on land. The hippo is among the most dangerous animals
      in the world due to its highly aggressive and unpredictable nature. They
      are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory
      canine teeth.
